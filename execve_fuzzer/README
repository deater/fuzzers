*** WARNING ***

This program will cause random executables on your system to be run
with random arguments.

There is a chance it might do something unfortunate, such as run
"rm" on an important file, or run "lpr" on a document that will
crash your printer, etc.

So it is advisable to either set up a dummy account or else run inside 
of Qemu or some other sandbox
